# Learning about Drasi
This repo contains code for a tutorial and a few sample applications that use Drasi as an end-to-end solution for change detection and real-time reactions. The tutorial The applications will help you understand how to implement and deploy Drasi for different scenarios. Each app folder within this repo has a README.md which details what the scenario for the app, code for the apps, requisite test data, and how to run the samples.
